## What
Replacement backend for CodeSandbox. Uses Google Firestore to store sandbox data and provides compatibility with Docket, 9 Dots' teaching platform.

## Why
9 Dots internship project. Wanted to have an all purpose coding platform and wanted to build off CodeSandbox, an open source, online sandbox style project manager. Currently, their backend is not open source, thus we had to make a backend where we could see the sandboxes and be able to connect them to our school platform, Docket.
